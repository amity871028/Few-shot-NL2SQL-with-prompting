SELECT To fix the SQL query, you can use the following code:  ```sql SELECT Document_ID FROM Paragraphs GROUP BY Document_ID HAVING COUNT(*) >= 1 AND COUNT(*) <= 2; ```  This query selects the `Document_ID` from the `Paragraphs` table, groups the results by `Document_ID`, and then applies the `HAVING` clause to filter the documents that have a count of paragraphs between 1 and 2.

SELECT T1.Document_ID FROM Documents AS T1 JOIN Paragraphs AS T2 ON T1.Document_ID = T2.Document_ID WHERE T2.Paragraph_Text = 'Brazil' AND T2.Paragraph_Text = 'Ireland'
self correction:
SELECT The given SQL query has an issue in the WHERE clause. The condition `T2.Paragraph_Text = 'Brazil' AND T2.Paragraph_Text = 'Ireland'` cannot be true at the same time because a single paragraph cannot have both "Brazil" and "Ireland" as its text. To fix this, you need to use the OR operator instead of the AND operator in the WHERE clause. Here's the fixed SQL query:  ```sql SELECT T1.Document_ID FROM Documents AS T1 JOIN Paragraphs AS T2 ON T1.Document_ID = T2.Document_ID WHERE T2.Paragraph_Text = 'Brazil' OR T2.Paragraph_Text = 'Ireland'; ```  This query selects the `Document_ID` from the `Documents` table and joins it with the `Paragraphs` table based on the matching `Document_ID`. Then, it applies the condition in the WHERE clause to retrieve the document IDs that have a paragraph with the text "Brazil" or "Ireland".

index is 380
SELECT document_id FROM Paragraphs WHERE paragraph_text  =  'Brazil' INTERSECT SELECT document_id FROM Paragraphs WHERE paragraph_text  =  'Ireland'

Here's the fixed SQL query:  ```sql SELECT Document_ID FROM Documents WHERE Document_ID IN (   SELECT Document_ID   FROM Paragraphs   WHERE Paragraph_Text = 'Brazil' OR Paragraph_Text = 'Ireland' ); ```  This query selects the `Document_ID` from the `Documents` table where the `Document_ID` is present in the subquery. The subquery retrieves the `Document_ID` from the `Paragraphs` table where the `Paragraph_Text` is either 'Brazil' or 'Ireland'. The main query then filters the `Document_IDs` based on the subquery results.
