What are the different models created by either the car maker General Motors or weighed more than 3500?
SQL correction:
SELECT The given SQLite SQL query has some issues. Here's the fixed query:  ```sql SELECT DISTINCT car_names.Model FROM car_names JOIN model_list ON car_names.Model = model_list.ModelId JOIN car_makers ON model_list.Maker = car_makers.Id JOIN cars_data ON car_names.MakeId = cars_data.Id WHERE car_makers.Maker = 'General Motors' OR cars_data.Weight > 3500; ```  Explanation of the fixed query: - The query starts by selecting the distinct `car_names.Model` column, which represents the different car models. - Then, it performs a series of JOIN operations to connect the necessary tables:   - It joins the `car_names` table with the `model_list` table using the `Model` and `ModelId` columns.   - It joins the `model_list` table with the `car_makers` table using the `Maker` and `Id` columns.   - It joins the `car_names` table with the `cars_data` table using the `MakeId` and `Id` columns. - Finally, the WHERE clause filters the results based on two conditions:   - The car maker is specified as 'General Motors' using the `car_makers.Maker = 'General Motors'` condition.   - The weight of the cars is greater than 3500 using the `cars_data.Weight > 3500` condition.  This fixed query will retrieve the distinct car models created by either the car maker General Motors or weighed more than 3500.
