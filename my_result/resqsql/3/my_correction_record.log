The condition `paragraph_text = 'Brazil' AND paragraph_text = 'Ireland'` will never be true because a single row cannot have both "Brazil" and "Ireland" in the `paragraph_text` column simultaneously.   To fix the query and retrieve the document ID with paragraph text 'Brazil' and 'Ireland', you can use the `IN` operator with a list of values. Here's the fixed SQL query:  ```sql SELECT document_id FROM paragraphs WHERE paragraph_text IN ('Brazil', 'Ireland') ```  This query will return the document IDs for paragraphs containing either 'Brazil' or 'Ireland' in the `paragraph_text` column.

SELECT There seems to be an issue with the given SQL query. The condition `year_of_founded < 2003 AND year_of_founded > 2003` is contradictory because it tries to filter orchestras that are founded before and after the same year.   To fix the query and retrieve the record companies used by orchestras founded before 2003 and those founded after 2003, you can use the following query:  ```sql SELECT DISTINCT o.record_company FROM orchestra o WHERE o.year_of_founded < 2003 OR o.year_of_founded > 2003 ```  This query uses the `OR` operator instead of `AND` to retrieve record companies used by orchestras founded either before 2003 or after 2003. The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that duplicate record companies are eliminated from the result.
