SELECT count(*) FROM Pets WHERE weight > 10
SELECT The original SQL query seems to correctly answer the question. It counts the number of pets with weight greater than 10. No JOIN operations, DISTINCT, DESC, or GROUP BY clauses are needed based on the provided question. Thus, the fixed SQL query would be the same as the original one:  ```sql SELECT count(*) FROM Pets WHERE weight  >  10 ```  Here, I've just capitalized the table name to maintain SQL syntax conventions, but in SQLite, table names are case-insensitive, so the original query would work as well.
