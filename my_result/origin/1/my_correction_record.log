SELECT To fix the given SQL query, we need to make several modifications. Here's the fixed SQL query:  ```sql SELECT AVG(country.GNP) AS mean_GNP, SUM(country.Population) AS total_population FROM country JOIN countrylanguage ON country.Code = countrylanguage.CountryCode WHERE country.Code = 'USA' AND countrylanguage.Language = 'English'; ```  Explanation of modifications:  1. The SELECT clause should include the aggregate functions AVG() and SUM() to calculate the mean GNP and total population, respectively. 2. The FROM clause should specify the main table as "country" since we need information from the country table. 3. The JOIN condition should connect the "country" and "countrylanguage" tables using the foreign key relationship "country.Code = countrylanguage.CountryCode". 4. The WHERE clause should filter the rows based on the country code 'USA' (assuming 'USA' represents the US territory) and the language 'English' (assuming that's the language spoken in the US territory). 5. The GROUP BY clause is not necessary as we are calculating aggregate values for the entire US territory.  Please note that the given question refers to "US territory," and without further context, it's assumed that 'USA' represents the US territory.
