self correction:
SELECT The SQLite SQL QUERY provided seems to be correct according to the instructions and database design provided.   It correctly selects the name and capacity of the stadium (from the "stadium" table), joins this table with the "concert" table using the shared "Stadium_ID" column (which is according to the defined foreign keys), then filters the concerts to those that are from the year 2014 or later. After that, it groups the results by "Stadium_ID" (it is mentioned to use GROUP BY on one column only) and orders the groups by the count of concerts in each group in descending order. Finally, it limits the result to only the first row, effectively only selecting the stadium with the most concerts.  Therefore, the FIXED SQL QUERY is the same as the provided SQL QUERY:  ```sql SELECT T1.name, T1.capacity  FROM stadium AS T1  JOIN concert AS T2  ON T1.Stadium_ID = T2.Stadium_ID  WHERE T2.year >= 2014  GROUP BY T1.Stadium_ID  ORDER BY COUNT(T2.concert_ID) DESC  LIMIT 1 ```

SELECT The provided SQL query already correctly answers the question: "How many pets have a greater weight than 10?". It is counting the number of records in the Pets table where the weight column value is greater than 10. No need to involve the other tables, no JOINs are needed here because the weight data resides in the Pets table itself. The fixed query is:  ```sql SELECT count(*) FROM Pets WHERE weight > 10 ```  Please note that SQLite is case-sensitive, so ensure your table name case matches the actual case in the database. If 'Pets' is the correct case, the provided query is correct. If 'pets' is the actual case, the original query is correct.
