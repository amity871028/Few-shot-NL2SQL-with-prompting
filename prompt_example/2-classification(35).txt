Q: "Find the buildings which have rooms with capacity more than 50."
schema_links: [classroom.building,classroom.capacity,50]
A: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the question "Find the buildings which have rooms with capacity more than 50." needs these tables = [classroom], so we don't need JOIN.
Plus, it doesn't require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [""].
So, we don't need JOIN and don't need nested queries, then the the SQL query can be classified as "EASY".
Label: "EASY"

Q: "What are the names of all instructors who advise students in the math depart sorted by total credits of the student."
schema_links: [advisor.i_id = instructor.id,advisor.s_id = student.id,instructor.name,student.dept_name,student.tot_cred,math]
A: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the question "What are the names of all instructors who advise students in the math depart sorted by total credits of the student." needs these tables = [advisor,instructor,student], so we need JOIN.
Plus, it doesn't need nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [""].
So, we need JOIN and don't need nested queries, then the the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED".
Label: "NON-NESTED"

Q: "Find the room number of the rooms which can sit 50 to 100 students and their buildings."
schema_links: [classroom.building,classroom.room_number,classroom.capacity,50,100]
A: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the question "Find the room number of the rooms which can sit 50 to 100 students and their buildings." needs these tables = [classroom], so we don't need JOIN.
Plus, it doesn't require nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = [""].

Q: "How many courses that do not have prerequisite?"
schema_links: [course.*,course.course_id = prereq.course_id]
A: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the question "How many courses that do not have prerequisite?" needs these tables = [course,prereq], so we need JOIN.
Plus, it requires nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN), and we need the answer to the questions = ["Which courses have prerequisite?"].
So, we need JOIN and need nested queries, then the the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED".
Label: "NESTED"

Q: "Find the title of course that is provided by both Statistics and Psychology departments."
