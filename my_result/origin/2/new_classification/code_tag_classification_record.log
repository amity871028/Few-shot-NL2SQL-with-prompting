classification:
The question is "What are the codes of the countries that do not speak English and whose government forms are not Republic?". No specific table is mentioned in the question. Since we don't have a specific table, we cannot determine if the query involves nested queries or multiple tables.

However, we can see that the question involves conditions related to language and government form, which suggests that it may require joining tables like "country" and "countrylanguage" to retrieve the desired information. Therefore, we can classify it as NON-NESTED since it potentially involves multiple tables.

classification:
The question is "Return the codes of countries that do not speak English and do not have Republics for governments." There is no specific mention of tables in the question, so we need to analyze the schema_links provided to determine the tables involved.

The schema_links indicate connections between tables [country], [countrylanguage], and [city]. So, tables = [country, countrylanguage, city]. If the number of tables >= 1, we predict NON-NESTED or NESTED.

Additionally, there are no sentences that match nested queries with (INTERSECT, UNION, EXCEPT, IN, NOT IN). If nested queries don't exist, we predict EASY or NON-NESTED.

So, the first step classification is NON-NESTED or NESTED, and the second step classification is EASY or NON-NESTED. Finally, the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED".
