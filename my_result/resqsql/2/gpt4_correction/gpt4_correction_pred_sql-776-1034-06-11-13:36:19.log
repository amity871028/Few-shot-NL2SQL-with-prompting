SELECT The given SQLite SQL query seems correct according to the given tables, columns, foreign keys, and primary keys. It returns the IDs of all students who do not have any friends.  The NOT EXISTS clause in the subquery checks if there are any records in the friend table where the ID of a student in the highschooler table matches the student_id in the friend table. If no records exist, it means that the student doesn't have any friends, and the ID of the student will be included in the result set.  Therefore, there is no need to modify the SQL query. Here is the fixed SQL query, which is same as the original one:  ```sql SELECT id FROM highschooler WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM friend WHERE highschooler.id = friend.student_id) ```
SELECT ID FROM Highschooler WHERE ID NOT IN (SELECT student_id FROM Friend)
SELECT min(grade) FROM Highschooler WHERE ID NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT student_id FROM Friend)
SELECT The given SQL query appears to be correctly formatted and does indeed answer the question. It first selects first names from the "professionals" table that are not found in the "dogs" table, and then does the same for the "owners" table. The use of the UNION operator ensures that only distinct names are returned.  Therefore, the fixed SQL query is the same as the provided one:  ```SQL SELECT first_name FROM Professionals WHERE first_name NOT IN (SELECT name FROM Dogs)  UNION  SELECT first_name FROM Owners WHERE first_name NOT IN (SELECT name FROM Dogs) ```
SELECT professional_id , role_code , email_address  FROM Professionals  WHERE professional_id NOT IN (SELECT professional_id FROM Treatments);
