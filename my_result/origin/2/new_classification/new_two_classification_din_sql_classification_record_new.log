SELECT The given SQLite SQL query has some issues. Here's the fixed version:  ```sql SELECT DISTINCT visitor.Name FROM visitor JOIN visit ON visit.visitor_ID = visitor.ID JOIN museum ON visit.Museum_ID = museum.Museum_ID WHERE museum.Open_Year < 2009 OR museum.Open_Year > 2011 ```  Explanation:  1) The WHERE clause condition `museum.Open_Year < 2009 AND museum.Open_Year > 2011` would not yield any results because it's impossible for a museum to be opened before 2009 and after 2011 at the same time. To find visitors who visited museums opened before 2009 or after 2011, we should use the logical OR operator (`OR`) instead of the logical AND operator (`AND`).  2) The SELECT statement and JOIN conditions were already correct, so no changes were necessary in those parts.  By making the above modifications, the fixed SQLite SQL query will correctly retrieve the name of the visitor who visited both a museum opened before 2009 and a museum opened after 2011.
