self correction:
SELECT The SQLite SQL QUERY appears to be correct for the given question. It correctly selects the continent id and name from the continents table, and counts the distinct number of country names from the countries table. This is done using a join operation on the shared key between the two tables, which is Continent in the countries table and ContId in the continents table. The resulting table is then grouped by the continent id.  So, the SQLite FIXED SQL QUERY is the same as the original one:  ```SQL SELECT contid, continent, COUNT(DISTINCT countryname)  FROM continents  JOIN countries  ON continents.contid = countries.continent  GROUP BY contid ```
