SELECT Templates.Template_ID, Templates.Template_Type_Code

FROM Templates
JOIN Documents ON Templates.Template_ID = Documents.Template_ID
GROUP BY Templates.Template_ID, Templates.Template_Type_Code
ORDER BY COUNT(Documents.Document_ID) DESC

```

This query retrieves the `Template_ID` and `Template_Type_Code` from the `Templates` table, joins it with the `Documents` table using the common `Template_ID`, groups the results by `Template_ID` and `Template_Type_Code`, and orders them by the count of `Document_ID` in descending order. Finally, it selects the first row using the `LIMIT 1` clause, which corresponds to the template used for the greatest number of documents.

For creating the SQL for the given question, we need to join the Tables Templates and Documents on the column Template_ID. We can then select the Template_ID from Templates that do not have a matching entry in Documents. Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT Templates.Template_ID
FROM Templates
LEFT JOIN Documents ON Templates.Template_ID = Documents.Template_ID
WHERE Documents.Template_ID IS NULL
```

This query uses a left join to match entries from Templates to Documents based on the Template_ID column. The WHERE clause filters out the rows where there is no match in Documents, effectively giving us the Template_IDs that are not used by any document.
