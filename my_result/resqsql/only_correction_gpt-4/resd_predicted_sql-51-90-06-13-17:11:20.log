SELECT The given SQL query seems to be written correctly according to the given question. It will select all student IDs from the Student table that do not own a pet cat. The subquery finds all students who have cats as pets, and then these IDs are excluded from the main query. Therefore, no modification to the SQL query is required.  The fixed SQL query is the same as the given SQL query:  ```sql SELECT stuid FROM student WHERE stuid NOT IN (SELECT has_pet.stuid FROM has_pet JOIN pets ON has_pet.petid  =  pets.petid WHERE pets.pettype  =  'cat') ```
SELECT The given SQLite SQL query looks correct as per the requirements of the question. The query correctly finds the first name and age of students who have a dog but do not have a cat as a pet. The joins and conditions are properly set up. Therefore, there is no need to change anything in the provided query. The fixed query is:  ```sql SELECT student.fname, student.age FROM student WHERE EXISTS (   SELECT * FROM has_pet   INNER JOIN pets ON has_pet.petid = pets.petid   WHERE has_pet.stuid = student.stuid   AND pets.pettype = 'dog' ) AND NOT EXISTS (   SELECT * FROM has_pet   INNER JOIN pets ON has_pet.petid = pets.petid   WHERE has_pet.stuid = student.stuid   AND pets.pettype = 'cat' ) ```
SELECT DISTINCT Student.Fname FROM Student INNER JOIN Has_Pet ON Student.StuID = Has_Pet.StuID INNER JOIN Pets ON Has_Pet.PetID = Pets.PetID WHERE EXISTS (     SELECT 1 FROM Has_Pet     INNER JOIN Pets ON Has_Pet.PetID = Pets.PetID     WHERE Pets.PetType = 'Dog' AND Has_Pet.StuID = Student.StuID ) AND NOT EXISTS (     SELECT 1 FROM Has_Pet     INNER JOIN Pets ON Has_Pet.PetID = Pets.PetID     WHERE Pets.PetType = 'Cat' AND Has_Pet.StuID = Student.StuID );
SELECT PetType, weight FROM Pets ORDER BY pet_age ASC LIMIT 1
SELECT PetType, weight FROM Pets WHERE pet_age  =  (SELECT MIN(pet_age) FROM Pets)
SELECT PetID , weight FROM Pets WHERE pet_age  >  1
SELECT PetID , weight FROM Pets WHERE pet_age  >  1
SELECT PetType ,  AVG(pet_age) ,  MAX(pet_age) FROM Pets GROUP BY PetType
SELECT PetType , AVG(pet_age) , MAX(pet_age) FROM Pets GROUP BY PetType
SELECT PetType , AVG(weight) FROM Pets GROUP BY PetType
SELECT PetType , AVG (weight) FROM Pets GROUP BY PetType
SELECT Fname, Age FROM Student  JOIN Has_Pet ON Student.StuID = Has_Pet.StuID
SELECT DISTINCT Student.Fname , Student.Age FROM Student JOIN Has_Pet ON Student.StuID  =  Has_Pet.StuID
SELECT The provided SQLite SQL query is correct for the provided question "Find the id of the pet owned by student whose last name is ‘Smith’." No changes or fixes are necessary.  So, the fixed SQL query is:  ```sql SELECT pets.petid FROM student JOIN has_pet ON student.stuid = has_pet.stuid JOIN pets ON has_pet.petid = pets.petid WHERE student.lname = 'Smith' ```
SELECT Has_Pet.PetID  FROM Student  JOIN Has_Pet ON Student.StuID = Has_Pet.StuID  WHERE Student.LName = 'Smith'
SELECT T1.StuID, COUNT(*) FROM Has_Pet AS T1  JOIN Student AS T2 ON T1.StuID = T2.StuID  JOIN Pets AS T3 ON T1.PetID = T3.PetID  GROUP BY T1.StuID
SELECT T1.StuID, COUNT(T2.PetID) FROM Student AS T1  JOIN Has_Pet AS T2  ON T1.StuID = T2.StuID  GROUP BY T1.StuID
SELECT fname, sex  FROM Student  JOIN Has_Pet ON Student.StuID = Has_Pet.StuID  GROUP BY Student.StuID  HAVING COUNT(Has_Pet.PetID) > 1
SELECT Fname, Sex  FROM Student  WHERE StuID IN (   SELECT StuID    FROM Has_Pet    GROUP BY StuID    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT PetID) > 1 )
SELECT LName  FROM Student  JOIN Has_Pet ON Student.StuID = Has_Pet.StuID  JOIN Pets ON Has_Pet.PetID = Pets.PetID  WHERE Pets.PetType = 'cat' AND Pets.pet_age = 3
SELECT Student.LName  FROM Student  JOIN Has_Pet ON Student.StuID = Has_Pet.StuID  JOIN Pets ON Has_Pet.PetID = Pets.PetID  WHERE Pets.PetType = 'cat' AND Pets.pet_age = 3
SELECT AVG(Age) FROM Student WHERE StuID NOT IN (SELECT StuID FROM Has_Pet)
SELECT avg(Age) FROM Student WHERE StuID NOT IN (SELECT StuID FROM Has_Pet)
SELECT count(*) FROM continents
SELECT count(DISTINCT Continent) FROM continents
SELECT continents.ContId , continents.Continent , count(DISTINCT countries.CountryId) FROM continents JOIN countries ON continents.ContId = countries.Continent GROUP BY continents.ContId, continents.Continent
SELECT The SQLite SQL QUERY appears to be correct for the given question. It correctly selects the continent id and name from the continents table, and counts the distinct number of country names from the countries table. This is done using a join operation on the shared key between the two tables, which is Continent in the countries table and ContId in the continents table. The resulting table is then grouped by the continent id.  So, the SQLite FIXED SQL QUERY is the same as the original one:  ```SQL SELECT contid, continent, COUNT(DISTINCT countryname)  FROM continents  JOIN countries  ON continents.contid = countries.continent  GROUP BY contid ```
