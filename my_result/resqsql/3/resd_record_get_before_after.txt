SELECT The given SQLite SQL QUERY has some issues. Here's the fixed version:  ```sql SELECT DISTINCT car_makers.Maker FROM car_makers JOIN model_list ON car_makers.Id = model_list.Maker JOIN car_names ON model_list.Model = car_names.Model JOIN cars_data ON car_names.MakeId = cars_data.Id WHERE cars_data.Year = 1970; ```  Explanation: 1) The original query didn't include any join conditions or tables related to car models, car names, or car data. We need to join these tables to get the relevant information. 2) We need to join the following tables based on their foreign key relationships: car_makers -> model_list -> car_names -> cars_data. 3) The WHERE clause is updated to check the year in the cars_data table. 4) The SELECT clause selects the distinct maker from the car_makers table.  Please note that the primary keys and foreign keys mentioned in the question are used to determine the join conditions between the tables.

SELECT There are some issues with the given SQL query. Here's the fixed SQL query:  ```sql SELECT DISTINCT o.record_company FROM orchestra o JOIN conductor c ON o.conductor_id = c.conductor_id WHERE o.year_of_founded < 2003 OR o.year_of_founded > 2003 GROUP BY o.record_company ```  Explanation of the fixes:  1) The `conductor` table is required to join with the `orchestra` table using the foreign key relationship.  2) The condition in the WHERE clause should use the OR operator instead of AND, as we want orchestras founded before 2003 or after 2003.  3) Added the DISTINCT keyword to eliminate duplicate record companies.  Please note that it is not possible for an orchestra to be founded both before and after 2003, so the result of this query would be an empty set.

SELECT The given SQLite SQL QUERY has some issues that need to be fixed. Here's the corrected version:  ```sql SELECT DISTINCT citizenship  FROM singer  WHERE birth_year < 1945 OR birth_year > 1955; ```  In the original query, the condition `birth_year < 1945 AND birth_year > 1955` would not return any results because a birth year cannot be simultaneously less than 1945 and greater than 1955. To address this issue, the logical operator needs to be changed from `AND` to `OR` to retrieve singers with birth years before 1945 or after 1955.
