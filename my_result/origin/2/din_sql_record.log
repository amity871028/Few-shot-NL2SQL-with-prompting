GROUP BY Departments.department_name, Departments.department_id

This query joins the Departments and Degree_Programs tables using the department_id foreign key and groups the result by department_name and department_id. It then orders the groups in descending order based on the count of degree_program_id and selects the first row using the LIMIT 1 clause.

SELECT The given SQLite SQL query has some issues. The conditions in the WHERE clause are contradictory. Birth year cannot be both before 1945 and after 1955 at the same time. To fix this query and retrieve the citizenships shared by singers with a birth year before 1945 OR after 1955, you can use the following fixed SQL query:  ```sql SELECT DISTINCT Citizenship FROM singer WHERE Birth_Year < 1945 OR Birth_Year > 1955; ```  This query selects distinct citizenship values from the "singer" table where the birth year is either before 1945 or after 1955. The DISTINCT keyword ensures that only unique citizenship values are returned.
