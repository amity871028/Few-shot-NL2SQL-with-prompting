SELECT The given SQLite SQL query has some issues. Here's the fixed query:  ```sql SELECT DISTINCT car_names.Model FROM car_names JOIN model_list ON car_names.Model = model_list.ModelId JOIN car_makers ON model_list.Maker = car_makers.Id JOIN cars_data ON car_names.MakeId = cars_data.Id WHERE car_makers.Maker = 'General Motors' OR cars_data.Weight > 3500; ```  Explanation of the fixed query: - The query starts by selecting the distinct `car_names.Model` column, which represents the different car models. - Then, it performs a series of JOIN operations to connect the necessary tables:   - It joins the `car_names` table with the `model_list` table using the `Model` and `ModelId` columns.   - It joins the `model_list` table with the `car_makers` table using the `Maker` and `Id` columns.   - It joins the `car_names` table with the `cars_data` table using the `MakeId` and `Id` columns. - Finally, the WHERE clause filters the results based on two conditions:   - The car maker is specified as 'General Motors' using the `car_makers.Maker = 'General Motors'` condition.   - The weight of the cars is greater than 3500 using the `cars_data.Weight > 3500` condition.  This fixed query will retrieve the distinct car models created by either the car maker General Motors or weighed more than 3500.

SELECT The given SQLite SQL query has a couple of issues. Here's the fixed version:  ```sql SELECT DISTINCT T1.name FROM Highschooler AS T1 JOIN Likes AS T2 ON T1.ID = T2.student_id GROUP BY T1.name HAVING COUNT(T2.liked_id) >= 2; ```  Explanation of changes made:  1) The table names in the query were not capitalized correctly. The correct table names are "Highschooler" and "Likes" (with capital letters at the beginning).  2) The JOIN condition was using the wrong column for the join. It should use `T1.ID = T2.student_id` instead of `T1.id = T2.student_id`.  3) The count function was using the wrong column for counting. It should use `COUNT(T2.liked_id)` instead of `COUNT(T1.id)`.  With these fixes, the SQL query will correctly return the names of students who have 2 or more likes.
